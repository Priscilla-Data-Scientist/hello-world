# Hello 👋 I'm Priscilla

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I am a Data Science learner with a strong background in Linguistics, 
especially Syntax. I am currently focusing on developing my skills 
in data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This GitHub space documents my learning journey, small projects, 
and experiments as I build practical skills in working with data 
and language.
